## About the Project

This project is a machine learning-based disease prediction system. It aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having a specific disease based on relevant features and data. Disease prediction using machine learning has the potential to improve early detection and diagnosis, ultimately contributing to better healthcare outcomes.

The project utilizes a dataset that contains relevant health and patient information, which is used to train and evaluate machine learning models for disease prediction. The goal is to create a robust and accurate model that can assist healthcare professionals in making informed decisions.

## Data Collection

- Describe the source of the dataset.
- Mention any data preprocessing steps applied to clean or prepare the data.

## Data Preprocessing

- Explain how the data was cleaned and transformed for model input.
- Detail any feature engineering or data augmentation techniques used.
- Include any code snippets for data preprocessing if applicable.

## Model Building

- Describe the machine learning algorithms or models used for disease prediction.
- Provide information on model hyperparameters and the training process.
- Mention any model optimization or fine-tuning steps.

## Evaluation

- Explain the evaluation metrics used to assess model performance.
- Present the results, including accuracy, precision, recall, and any other relevant metrics.
- Include visualizations or plots to illustrate model performance.
